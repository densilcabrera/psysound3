    % TYPE 1 - COMPLEX AVERAGE BASED ON OVERALL AVERAGE PHASE
    % this method of complex averaging finds the 'mean' phase difference for each
    % spectrum component between every window of the analysis. This 'mean'
    % is done for real and imaginary components of the phase angle, which
    % are then recombined into a phase angle. This mean difference multiplied 
    % by the window number is then subtracted from the original phase
    % spectrum, and combined with the magnitude spectrum prior to taking
    % the complex average of the spectra.
    % 
    % This method is sensitive to steady state tones throughout the recording, or 
    % other perfectly periodic characteristics in the recording. It
    % suppresses spectral components that have random or varying phase changes between
    % windows.
    
    % real and imaginary phase difference between windows
    DiffRealAngle      = cos(DiffPhase);
    DiffImAngle        = sin(DiffPhase);

    AvPhaseStep1        = angle(complex(mean(DiffRealAngle,1),mean(DiffImAngle,1)));

    PhaseCorrectedSpec1 = power2dB(abs(mean(Magnitude .* exp(j*Phase1),1)).^2);
        

    
    % TYPE 3 - COMPLEX AVERAGE BASED ON LOCAL AVERAGE PHASE
    % This method compares the phase values for each window to those of the
    % surrounding eight windows (four on either side). If there is no
    % difference, a phase angle of 0 is used for the complex spectrum
    % average. Differences result in non-zero phase angles which will tend
    % to suppress the average for that spectral component.
    %
    % The value of this method is that it is sensitive to local
    % periodicities (e.g., musical tones from an instrument), which may not
    % be reflected by long term periodicities. Of course, the periodicities
    % should span at least nine windows to be picked up in the present
    % implementation.
