function obj = assignOutputs(obj, dataIn, dataBuf, s)
% ASSIGNOUTPUTS This method updates the output structure with each
%               new block of analysed data.  The output structures
%               (and any underlying data objects, eg. timeseries)
%               should already be allocated and all that should be
%               needed is assignment

% Append to the end of the block
  dataBuf.data.assign(dataIn);

% end assignOutputs
